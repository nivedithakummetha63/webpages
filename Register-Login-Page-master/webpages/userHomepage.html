                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    Register/Login is a secure user authentication and authorization system that I 
                    built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, and Node.js with MongoDB 
                    for the backend. It enables users to register, log in, update their passwords, 
                    and delete their accounts, with all operations securely managed using the 
                    Passport npm package. This system showcases my ability to develop full-stack 
                    applications with a strong focus on security and user experience.

                        <p>
                            In the Register/Login project, the <b>Create operation</b> is demonstrated when a user's email, username, and hashed password are written to the MongoDB database. Below is a list of checks performed before storing the credentials in the database:
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Providing a username, email, and password is mandatory, and the sign-up process will not proceed unless all fields are filled.</li>

                                Custom validation is implemented to ensure:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The username is not empty and does not have spaces.</li>

                                Implemented validation to ensure strong passwords are used:

                                    <li>No empty spaces are allowed.</li>
                                    <li>Must be at least 8 characters long and at most 12 characters allowed.</li>

                            <li>A 6-digit confirmation code is sent to the user's email to verify its validity and prevent fake entries. The account is created only after the correct code is entered by the user.</li>
                            <li>Passwords are hashed using <b>passport npm package</b> before being stored in the MongoDB database.</li>

                            In the Register/Login project, the <b>Read Operation</b> is demonstrated when a user's username and password are read from the database for authentication and signing out. Below is a list of actions performed during the user sign-in and sign-out process: 
                        </p>

                            <li>Sessions and cookies are used to maintain user login status across different pages. The session data is stored in the MongoDB database using <b>connect-mongo</b> npm package.</li>
                            <li>Redirects users to the userHomepage upon successful login.</li>

                            <li>The new password is hashed and securely stored in the database, replacing the old one.</li>
                            <li>The token is deleted from the database after the password is updated securely.</li>
