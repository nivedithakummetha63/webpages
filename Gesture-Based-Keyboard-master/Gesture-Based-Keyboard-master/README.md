# Gesture-Based-Keyboard
The project "Virtual Keyboard" built using cv-zone and Mediapipe in Python.
It involves creating a computer vision-based system that allows users to interact with a virtual keyboard using hand gestures.
The project utilizes the cv-zone library, which provides a collection of computer vision functions and tools, and the Mediapipe library.
These libraries offer a comprehensive framework for building machine learning pipelines for perception tasks.
